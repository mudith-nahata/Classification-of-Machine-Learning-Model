# Classification-of-Machine-Learning-Model Using Logistic Regression Algorithm 
# Steps Involved
# 0. Preprocess + EDA + Feature Selection
    ---> The preprocessing of the data is to clean the unwanted data,outliers,duplicate data etc.
    ---> EDA stands for "Exploratory Data Analysis", which is used to analyze the data and plot the graphs. 
    ---> Feature Selection is selecting the Input column from the given dataset.

# 1. Extract input and output cols
     ---> The Extracting of the Input and 
# 2. Scale the values
# 3. Train test split
# 4. Train the model
# 5. Evaluate the model/model selection
# 6. Deploy the model
