# Classification-of-Machine-Learning-Model Using Logistic Regression.
# Steps Involved
# 0. Preprocess + EDA + Feature Selection
    ---> The preprocessing of the data is to clean the unwanted data,outliers,duplicate data etc.
    ---> EDA stands for "Exploratory Data Analysis", which is used to analyze the data and plot the graphs. 
    ---> Feature Selection is selecting the Input column from the given dataset.
  # output:
